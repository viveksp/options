<h3>SELL CALL</h3>
</center>
<img align="right" src="images/os-022g.gif"> <b>Strategy View</b><br>
Investor is certain that the market will not rise and and is unsure/unconcerned
whether it will fall. 

<p><b>Strategy Implementation</b><br>
Call option is sold with a strike price of <i>a</i>. If the investor is very
certain of his view then at-the-money options should be sold, if less certain,
then out-of-the-money ones should be sold. </p>

<p><b>Upside Potential</b><br>
Limited to the premium received - received if the market at expiry is at, or
below, the option strike. </p>

<p><b>Downside Risk</b><br>
Unlimited. Losses on the position will worsen as the market rises. [If the
investor likes the idea of the strategy, but not the downside risk, they might
be interested in a <a href="os-023.htm">bear spread</a>]. </p>

<p><b>Margin</b><br>
Always required </p>

<p><b>Comment</b><br>
If the market does little, and time passes, this helps as the short position
gains when the time value erodes </p>
