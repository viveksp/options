<h3>Explanation of the Strategy Descriptions</h3>
Each of the 17 strategy descriptions is explained using the following template: 
<ul>
  <li><b>Strategy View</b> - when to use the strategy </li>
  <li><b>Strategy Implementation</b> - how to effect the strategy </li>
  <li><b>Upside Potential</b> - limited/unlimited </li>
  <li><b>Downside Risk</b> - limited/unlimited </li>
  <li><b>Margin</b> - whether required or not </li>
  <li><b>Comment</b> - usually a comment on the effect of the passage of time
    on position value . </li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h4>Strategy Profit/Loss Chart</h4>
The profitability of each stategy is represented by a chart. (The chart here
represents the profit/loss profile for a <i>buy call</i> strategy). 

<p><img align="right" alt="example_chart" src="images/os-pl.gif"> Whenever the
red line is above the horizontal line, the strategy is in profit, and when
below in loss. We can see from this particular chart, that profit increases as
the share price increases, but that as the share price falls the loss is
limited at a certain level. </p>

<p>The point <i>a</i> usually represents the value of the strike price
(additional points are marked in the case of multiple option strategies). This
point can be used as a reference point when judging the profitability for any
particular strategy. The point <i>b</i> here represents the breakeven point for
the strategy - which in this case is the level of the share price equal to the
strike price plus the premium paid for the call option. </p>

<p><b>N.B. It must be noted that these charts represent the profit/loss profile
<i>only at expiry</i> of the options</b>. </p>

<p>All 17 profit/loss profile charts can be <a href="os-0a.htm">seen together
on one page</a>, reduced as thumbnail images. </p>

<h3>Further Notes</h3>
<ol>
  <li>These option strategies are largely independent of the underlying asset,
    hence in this area we have used the following terms loosely and
    interchangeably: <i>asset</i>, <i>share price</i>, <i>index</i>,
    <i>commodity</i>. </li>
  <li>In a similar fashion the terms <i>strike</i> and <i>exercise price</i>
    are used here interchangeably. </li>
</ol>
