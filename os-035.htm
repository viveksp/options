<h3>COVERED CALL - long stock, sell call</h3>
</center>
<img align="right" src="images/os-035g.gif"> <b>Strategy View</b><br>
An investor holds stock but does not think the stock will rise in the short
term, or that the stock will be neutral, income can be gained by selling call
options against the stock holding. 

<p><b>Strategy Implementation</b><br>
Call options are sold. The number of call options sold will be determined by
the investor's market view and the size of the stock holding. </p>

<p><b>Upside Potential</b><br>
Limited - by selling calls, the investor is writing off the potential prfit of
the stock position. Maximum profit is the strike minus the market price plus
the premium received. </p>

<p><b>Downside Risk</b><br>
Large: Similar to that incurred with ordinary stock ownership, only off-set
partially by the (fixed) option premium received. Main loss could be the
opportunity loss if the market rises strongly. </p>

<p><b>Margin</b><br>
Always required </p>
