<h3>CALENDAR SPREAD</h3>
</center>
<img align="right" src="images/os-034g.gif"> <b>Strategy View</b><br>
Investor thinks that the market will be weak in the short-term, but rally in
the longer-term. 

<p><b>Strategy Implementation</b><br>
Near dated call option is sold, and a longer-dated call option with the same
strike is bought. [If the investor holds the opposite view, then a comparable
strategy can be construced with puts]. </p>

<p><b>Upside Potential</b><br>
Large, if the bought option is held after the short option expires (the
position then becomes a straight-forward <a href="os-011.htm">buy call</a>). If
the position is closed at expiry of the near option, maximum profit will accrue
if the market is at the level of the sold strike. </p>

<p><b>Breakeven Point at Expiry</b><br>
Strike price plus premium </p>

<p><b>Downside Risk</b><br>
Limited to the initial debit incurred for establishing the spread. . </p>

<p><b>Margin</b><br>
Off-set may be available. </p>

<p><b>Comment</b><br>
There is a risk of the sold options being called (i.e. being exercised).<br>
Sometimes called a <i>horizontal</i> or <i>time</i> spread. </p>
